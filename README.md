# Battleship
The game of battleship, in as basic a representation as it comes. 

When the game begins, a ship is randomly placed on the board.

The player will be prompted to input a row number then a column number for where to strike.

The board is 5x5 (with each column going from 0 to 4). An input of 5 or greater will be off the board/not valid.

An 'X' is placed on the board to keep track of where the player has already struck.

The player gets 4 tries to guess where the ship is.

After Turn 4, it's game over, and the location of the ship will be printed.
